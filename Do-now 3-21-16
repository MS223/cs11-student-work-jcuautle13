# In comments:
# What does randint do?
# Randint chooses a random number from the list.
# What do the values 0 and 3 do?
# It identifies the numbers between 0 and 3.
# Try changing those numbers, rerun the program, and write down what changed.
# A different set of numbers are shown everytime I run the program because it chooses 3 random numbers between 1 and 4.
# What is the difference between random.randint(0,3) and print(random.randint(0,3))?
# random.randint(0,3) chooses random numbers that are between 0 and 3, while print(random.randit(0,3)) literally just prints an error because there's a "()" after print.
