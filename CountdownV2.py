x = input("Give me a number") # This first starts off with the string, "Give me a number", which then whatever number you put in will be set into the input for x.
while x > 0: # This can also be seen as a boolean (It's actually a while loop) because if you give the number 10, 10 is greater than 0. 
    print x # literally prints x, but in this case it's 10. 
    x = x - 1 # Since we're counting down from 10, it should not have a "+" sign. It needs a "-" sign since the numbers will decrease. 
print "BOOM!" #Prints Boom! when it hits 0.
